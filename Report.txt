On running the codes on the 3 datasest,the conclusions were as follows:

1.Quicksort and Not Randomized Quicksort almost gave similar times for the random test.
But Not Randomized Quicksort took quadratic time for the wirst case (descending order).

2.Bubblesort gave quadratic times for all cases (O(n^2) always).

We concluded that:
1.Quicksort : O(nlogn) average and worst case
2.Not Randomized Quicksort:O(nlogn average,O(n^2) worst case
3.Bubblesort : O(n^2) average and worst case.


Later we also saw the proof ad to why Quickosrt gives nlogn running time.
