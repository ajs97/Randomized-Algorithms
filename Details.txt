The codes and test data are as follows:

We have three codes:Bubblesort,Not Randomized Quicksort(or just quicksort) and Randomized Quicksort.

There are 7 sets of test cases on which we have tested them. The first 6 are randomly generated tests with input size increasing gradually from 50 to 50000.
The last test is the first 100000 natural numbers in descending order (worst case for BubbleSort and Not Randomized Quicksort).
